# SRT-Server: Powering the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics studies <br>

## Overview
We develop SRT-Server to perform the analysis of spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. It includes quality control (QC), spatially variable gene detection (SVG), deconvolution (DECON), cell typing (CT), spatial domain detection (SDD), differential gene expression analysis (DEG), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), cell-cell communication identification (CCC) and pseudo-time trajectory inference (TRAJ). <br>
The user can use the server to visit the website: https://spatialtranscriptomicsanalysis.com

## Update log
<strong>Version 2.0 (Jan 2023)</strong><br>
We update R into version 4.2.1 and fix some bugs. We combine the Annot module to CT module. <br>
<strong>Version 1.0 (Dec 2022)</strong><br>
We first build the SRT-Server to power the spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data analysis. 

## Example Data
We supplies the example data of MERFISH and 10x Visium data. All the data should be unzipped.

## Q&A
If there are any problems for SRT-Server, please feel free to ask here. We will ask you as soon as possible.
