# SRT-Server: Powering the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics studies <br>

## Overview
We develop SRT-Server to perform the analysis of spatial resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. It includes quality control (QC), spatially variable gene detection (SVG), deconvolution (DECON), cell typing (CT), spatial domain detection (SDD), differential gene expression analysis (DEG), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), cell-cell communication identification (CCC) and pseudo-time trajectory inference (TRAJ). <br>
The user can use the server to visit the website: https://www.spatialtranscriptomicsanalysis.com:7777

## Example Data
We supplies the example data of MERFISH and 10x Visium data. All the data should be unzip to .
